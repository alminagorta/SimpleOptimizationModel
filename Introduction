Many U.S. water bodies are impaired due to excessive nutrients. Excess nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen stimulate algae growth, reduce dissolved oxygen, and negatively impact aquatic habitat and water supplies for downstream urban and agricultural users.  The Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program provides a mechanism to improve the water quality of impaired water bodies and meet the associated in-stream water quality standards and designated uses.  Typically TMDLs provide information regarding the current pollutant loads to an impaired water body and then present a plan to reduce and reallocate loads among pollutant sources to meet the in-stream water quality standard. TMDLs often require the use of best management practices (BMPs) to reduce contaminant loads from non-point sources such as farms, range land, and animal feeding operations.  In these instances, identifying, selecting, and locating BMPs is a concern (Maringanti et al. 2009).
