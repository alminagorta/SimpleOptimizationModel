# Simple Optimization Model to Reduce Phosphorus Loading in Watersheds

A simple optimization model is developed to identify cost-effective best management practices (BMPs)
to reduce phosphorus loading in sub-watersheds. The model is applied at the Echo Reservoir, Utah and 
tests the feasibility of proposed total maximum daily load (TMDL) allocations based on potential BMP options. 
The model provides information regarding the spatial redistribution of loads among sub-watersheds. 


## Input and Output of the Model
The model uses the TMDL water quality study and relevant BMP information. Model outputs comprise reports 
The type of BMP to implement, how much phosphorus is going to reduce and the total cost of implementation. Figure below presents the main inputs and outputs of the model.
